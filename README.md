# BOOBAE Personal Site

Current release on August 1st, 2020.

I'll have a more thorough README to come soon to help with any contributions people would like to make. Or if you're just curious about the stack and architecture of this thing.

In the mean time, please check out the site at [boobae.blog](https://boobae.blog)!

Welcome to my favorite project! Have a look around.
