You want to be `Number 1` at whatever it is that you enjoy doing.
But you should never stop evolving along the way. You keep redefining. If you pick something arbitrary, such as becoming the fastest runner in the world, then you'll have to beat Usain Bolt. Which is too hard of a task.

`Escape competition through authenticity`
Instead, you keep changing your goal. your specific knowledge, skillsets, capabilities, and interests will evolve along that goal.

The 2 concepts you focus on are:

- I want to be the best at what I do
- What I do is flexible so that I am the best at it.
- Keep this in mind and keep applying it. Until you've found something that resonates with you and keeps you authentic.
