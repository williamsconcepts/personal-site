## Welcome to daily Tips

> Today i have a little Tip to share with you’ll from my note, so stay tuned and hear the nice TIP for today, it might be helpful.

## ABUNDANCE Find Me, Whenever i feel ABUNDANT.

> - well, if i must say.
>   When you make the conscious correlation between what you have been feeling and what is actualizing in your life experience, now you are empowered to make changes. If you are not making that correlation, and so continue to offer thoughts of lack about things you want, the things you want will continue to elude you.
>   People, often, in this misunderstanding begin to assign power to things outside of themselves in order to explain why they are not thriving in the way they would like: “I’m not thriving because I was born into the wrong environment. I’m not thriving because my parents didn’t thrive, so they couldn’t teach me how to do it. I’m not thriving because those people over there are thriving, and they’re taking the resources that should have been mine. I’m not thriving because I was cheated, because I’m not worthy, because I didn’t live the right way in a past life, because my government ignores my rights, because my husband doesn’t do his part ... because, because, because.” we always keep giving excuses.

> - So we want to remind you, your “not thriving” is only because you are offering a vibration that is different from the vibration of thriving. You cannot feel poor (and vibrate poor) and thrive. Abundance cannot find you unless you offer a vibration of abundance.

Many ask, “But if I’m not thriving, then how in the world can I offer a vibration of thriving?
Don’t I have to thrive before I can offer the vibration of thriving?”
