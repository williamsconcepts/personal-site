# About Me

Hi williams From Nigeria. a full-stack web developer. I love to code websites and stuff like that while Bae sneaks into my Blog to write contents that benefit others, you can imagine.

I started learning to code HTML and CSS in 2016 after I joined the tetiary institution. I was a little on-and-off with my learning up until the end of the year in 2016 where I decided that web development was, indeed, the career I wanted to pursue. From there, I jumped into Learning PHP and MySQL Database and have been falling more and more in love with web development ever since.

After coding, I also really enjoy design. My favorite sans-serif
fonts are [Helvetica](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat). I don't really have a favorite serif font (yet), but they're cool too, I guess.

One of my favorite things to do is take my passion for design and love for coding and combine them in my projects. I'm obssessed with gorgeous UI's; designing my own (for clients or otherwise) is so satisfying. And then translating that into code and crafting a truly memorable UX is my passion.


Some hobbies of mine include music and sports. Love reading audioly. I also really really love my Dog -Blue.

Learning never exhausts the mind.
